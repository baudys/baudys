## 💭 **ABOUT ME**

I'm just a young kid who wants to make his dreams come true and I believe that programming 💻 will lead me to it one day. In 2015, I started designing and photography 📸. I first encountered Programming 🖥️ in 2019 and was immediately hooked. Since then I've managed to create dozens of projects, both for myself and for clients. It is also worth mentioning I have successfully passed the Microsoft Office Specialist exams 📖 in PowerPoint 🟠 and Word 🔵 at the bett 2023 event in London.
